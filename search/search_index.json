PYRA has its own unique cryptocurrency exchange which allows you to trade binance coin (BNB) for PYRA tokens. PYRA tokens are tokens with a clever twist: Every PYRA holder receives direct earnings in BNB every time that anyone else buys, sells or trades the token based on the amounts of tokens (in % out of total amount minted) held. This means that as soon as you hold PYRA tokens, you are continuously accumulating \"free\" BNB distributed to you on every transaction based on the amount of PYRA tokens you hold on the exchange! This exchange and token is made better by the fact that the entire system is powered by an open-source smart contract deplyed on Binance Smart Chain ensuring transparency, security and trust. Understanding this Exchange The core functionality of this exchange is entirely powered only by a deployed open-source Binance smart contract. Smart contracts are immutable and this means there is no one who has access to these funds but this autonomous program. You can see the full source code for the contract managing this exchange at any time on BSC Scan. This PYRA exchange is unlike any other you've seen and certain aspects may surprise you at first. This section tries to lay out the important things to understand: Smart contracts require a transaction to be sent for every action taken. This means that every action you take on the exchange requires a transaction to be sent through by the user on the Binance network. All actions including \"Reinvest\", \"Withdraw\", \"Sell\", \"Transfer\", etc require a \"0\" BNB transaction to be sent (with GAS which costs BNB, make sure you account for this!). This is why you see so many \"0\" BNB transactions here. The PYRA smart contract manages all the funds for this exchange. However, accessing secure smart contract data can be a bit slow at times under high load which is why the main exchange front-end site often may feel sluggish. You can always use backup sites to perform all the same functionality. You can also interact directly with the contract. When you are buying or selling on the exchange, you are buying or selling directly from the PYRA smart contract, not other users. The PYRA smart contract is solely responsible for issuing tokens and increasing supply as well as burning tokens and reducing supply. This happens automatically on all buys and sells to the exchange. In addition, the smart contract is solely responsible for determining the value of the PYRA token as well.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#what-is-pyra","text":"PYRA is a dApp built on Binance Smart Chain.

The rules of this coin are simple yet also brilliant. Quick summary: 1. Buy Tokens. Buy PYRA tokens, and 10% of your transaction is used to pay earnings to other users. 2. Accumulate Earnings. Accumulate BNB earnings as other users buy, sell, or transfer PYRA. 3. Reinvest or Withdraw. Reinvest or withdraw your BNB earnings as they accumulate. 4. Sell Tokens or Don't! Sell your tokens at any time to receive BNB back from the exchange. 5. Share your Masternode. If you buy enough tokens for a masternode, share your masternode link to get bonus earnings! 6. Have Fun! Have fun watching as your earnings and coin value fluctuate over time! Longer, more detailed summary to outline the mechanics: 1. As soon as you exchange the PYRA tokens for your BNB, there is a 10% exchange tax incurred. This means if you exchange 10 BNB into PYRA the exchange will provide you 9BNB worth of tokens due to that tax. 2. Unlike a normal exchange, that 10% exchange tax is then completely distributed to all other token holders that have used this exchange. The distribution of earnings is divided fairly based on the number of PYRA tokens each user holds. The site owners directly keep none of that tax, this all goes to other users. 3. Now that you hold PYRA tokens, every single time a new person uses the exchange to receive PYRA tokens, you also get paid your share of the 10% exchange tax on their transaction. The amount you receive is based directly on the number of PYRA tokens you hold. Keep in mind though that all earnings are paid directly in BNB. In this way, you collect new earnings in real-time on every buy. 4. Even better, you also collect earnings from other types of transactions such as other users selling or users transferring tokens. Yes, this means you are getting paid earnings directly in BNB every time a user buys, sells, or transfers tokens! 5. As your personal earnings accumulate, you can check the site anytime to see how many earnings you've earned and then choose to either \"withdraw\" or \"reinvest\" your earnings. If you withdraw, you get the BNB earnings sent directly to your metamask wallet. If you reinvest, the BNB earnings are used to purchase yourself additional PYRA tokens. 6. Every time a new user purchases a token, the value of each token increases very slightly (+10 gwei). This means that as people buy into the exchange, your PYRA tokens are worth more and more BNB. However, as people sell their tokens, the value of each token you hold goes down (-10 gwei). 7. Continue accumulating PYRA tokens by reinvesting (and/or withdrawing \"free\" BNB from your earnings). 8. If you bought enough tokens for a masternode, share your masternode link to get bonus earnings. For every buy directly purchased from your masternode, you get an extra 3% of the buy-in price. For example, if a friend buys 10BNB from your masternode, you make 0.3BNB in earnings right away! 9. You can sell tokens at any time directly back to the exchange, and the exchange will provide you back BNB based on the current sell exchange price. 10. Have fun watching as your earnings and coin value fluctuate over time! That's all you really need to know! Is this a scam or a fraud? An understandable question given there are a lot of scams in Cryptocurrency. You are probably familiar with scam-like operations like Davor and Bitconnect. The important thing to remember is that: Scamcoins generally have big pre-mines where developers take a huge amount of coin for themselves. PYRA has no pre-mine. Scamcoins generally involve shady anonymous site owners holding your money while you \"earn\". These owners could take your money and exit scam you at anytime. PYRA has no one controlling your money, the exchange is entirely operated by an BNB open-source smart contract which cannot be changed! Owners cannot take BNB you put into the contract, even if they wanted to. Scamcoins usually make false promises about guaranteed returns or other claims of ROI which cannot be sustained. PYRA makes literally no promises and is completely open and transparent about the mechanics of the system. In short, this is not a scam. This is a unique exchange powered by smart contract which taxes all transactions (buy, sell, transfer) in order to pay out earnings to all token holders! The developers keep no extra fee beyond the tokens they hold.","title":"Buy/Sell"},{"location":"get-started/buy/#how-does-this-work","text":"The rules of this coin are simple yet also brilliant.

Earnings are especially awesome because their value is not determined by the value of PYRA tokens. The earnings distributed are sent to token holders in BNB every time that anyone else buys, sells or transfers the token based on the amounts of tokens (in % out of total amount minted) held. This means that no one can take these earnings away from you, they are entirely yours to either reinvest (convert to PYRA), leave on exchange to accumulate, or withdraw to your wallet to keep! The choice is entirely up to you! Remember: These dividends paid out to you are yours no matter what happens to the contract or the price of the tokens. Even if the value of the tokens plummet and everyone pulls out their money, that will only increase your earnings since you get them on every single sell. How much can I expect in dividends/earnings per day? You cannot expect a specific amount of dividends in a day because earnings are entirely based on transaction volume of the exchange. The earnings distributed are sent to token holders in BNB every time that anyone else buys, sells or transfers the token on the exchange. The amount of earnings received is based on the amounts of tokens (in % out of total amount minted) held at the time of the transaction. If there was zero transactions in a day, then your earnings would be zero. That said, the exchange is highly active. Many users report receiving 0.1-2% in earnings on a daily basis (again, your mileage may vary widely, this entirely depends on the exchange transaction volume and is not at all promised anywhere). What exactly is reinvesting? Re-investing means that you are choosing to take all your BNB earnings (dividends) and exchange them all for additional PYRA tokens. During re-investment, an additional 10% buy tax is incurred as with all transactions. In this way, reinvesting your tokens increases your holdings, thereby increasing future earnings. Think \"compound interest\". To reinvest, you can check out this short step-by-step video. Or follow these steps: 1. Go to the purchase tokens page 2. Click \"Reinvest\" on the right-hand side 3. Wait for a metamask transaction dialog to pop-up 4. Set the GWEI to \"3\" for Gas Price 5. Review the metamask transaction (should show BNB sent as 0) 6. Hit \"Send\" to start the reinvestment transaction 7. Wait 1-5 minutes for the the transaction to complete. 8. Refresh your exchange page. Note that the transaction should display 0BNB.

However, if there was mass hysteria and every single person sold, the value of the PYRA tokens would be significantly reduced which would mean your token holdings would be worth very little Ethereum.
