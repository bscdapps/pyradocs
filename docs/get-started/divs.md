# Why are earnings (dividends) the best part of PYRA?

Earnings are especially awesome because their value is not determined by the value of PYRA tokens. The earnings distributed are sent to token holders in BNB every time that anyone else buys, sells or transfers the token based on the amounts of tokens (in % out of total amount minted) held.

This means that no one can take these earnings away from you, they are entirely yours to either reinvest (convert to PYRA), leave on exchange to accumulate, or withdraw to your wallet to keep! The choice is entirely up to you!

Remember: These dividends paid out to you are yours no matter what happens to the contract or the price of the tokens. Even if the value of the tokens plummet and everyone pulls out their money, that will only increase your earnings since you get them on every single sell. 

## How much can I expect in dividends/earnings per day?

You cannot expect a specific amount of dividends in a day because earnings are entirely based on transaction volume of the exchange. The earnings distributed are sent to token holders in BNB every time that anyone else buys, sells or transfers the token on the exchange. The amount of earnings received is based on the amounts of tokens (in % out of total amount minted) held at the time of the transaction.

If there was zero transactions in a day, then your earnings would be zero. That said, the exchange is highly active. Many users report receiving 0.1-2% in earnings on a daily basis (again, your mileage may vary widely, this entirely depends on the exchange transaction volume and is not at all promised anywhere). 

## What exactly is reinvesting? 

Re-investing means that you are choosing to take all your BNB earnings (dividends) and exchange them all for additional PYRA tokens. During re-investment, an additional 10% buy tax is incurred as with all transactions. In this way, reinvesting your tokens increases your holdings, thereby increasing future earnings. Think "compound interest".

To reinvest, you can check out this short step-by-step video. Or follow these steps:

    1. Go to the purchase tokens page
    2. Click "Reinvest" on the right-hand side
    3. Wait for a metamask transaction dialog to pop-up
    4. Set the GWEI to "3" for Gas Price
    5. Review the metamask transaction (should show BNB sent as 0)
    6. Hit "Send" to start the reinvestment transaction
    7. Wait 1-5 minutes for the the transaction to complete.
    8. Refresh your exchange page.

Note that the transaction should display 0BNB. Once this transaction completes, your BNB will have been exchanged for additional PYRA tokens.
